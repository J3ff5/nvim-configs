# My not-that-good nvim setup

First of all, this is a totally personal repository, if you didn't like something here, just fork or clone and change what ever shit you want.

This is a in-progressing repository, but I'm too lazy to create releases of this code. Just clone the master and be happy (probably it's the only brach you'll find out)

> This is not a dot folder. If you're using linux, clone this inside your `.config` folder. To mac user I don't know, maby the same?
